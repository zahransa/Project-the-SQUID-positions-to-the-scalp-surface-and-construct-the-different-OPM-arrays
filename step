    You can calculate signal power of a source just by taking the squared norm of the corresponding column of the lead field matrix (L). For example, the signal power of the source i is norm(L(:,i))^2. You can separate the different field components the sensors measure.
    Total information (TI) can be calculated using the formula in the attached figure. K is the signal covariance matrix and sigma is the noise covariance matrix, det is the determinant of the matrix. For example, lets say you have identically and independently distributed sources with variance q^2.
    The source covariance matrix is q^2*I, where I is the identitity matrix with size (Nsources x Nsources). The signal covariance matrix is then K = L * q^2* I *L^T = q^2 L * L^T, where T is the transpose. If you model just sensor noise, your noise covariance matrix is Sigma = s^2 * I, where I is the (NsensorsxNsensors) identitity matrix and s^2 is the sensor noise variance.
